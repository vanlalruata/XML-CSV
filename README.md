# XML-to-CSV

I was downloading a dataset with xml format, I want to convert it to csv as I need to work with the CSV format instead of XML. So, I searched the web to do the work for me, but it was not getting the right tools. So I code this, and hopefully it will help if you are working with Network Traffic. It may be applicable for other purpose also.

If there is any suggestion, please let me know.
